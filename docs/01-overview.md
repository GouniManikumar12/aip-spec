# 01 · Overview

The AIP protocol defines how supply-side platforms, demand-side bidders, and auditing agents communicate intent, enforce policy, and settle value. This chapter summarizes guiding principles such as interoperability by default, transparency, and verifiability.

- **Interoperability:** JSON-based payloads with explicit versioning keep integrations predictable.
- **Extensibility:** Optional sections allow experimentation without fragmenting the ecosystem.
- **Safety:** Every transport includes authentication, encryption, and replay protection requirements.
